The goals of bkjs javascript framework:

(1) Do as much display logic as possible on the client side
(2) Don't hit the server unless necessary, 
(3) use html5 pushState for links if available, fallback to hashbang
(4) use ajax to fetch the display logic for the view of a page the first time you come to it. 
(5) subsequently remember how to display the view so you don't have to hit the server if you re-visit the same url, even if some details are different.
(6) use javascript to store session token from the server, thus no need for session cookie
(7) use a mostly RESTful url scheme for forms
(8) ARIA accessibility as much as possible
(9) Search engine friendly as much as possible for this kind of client side framework.
(10) should be able to fetch a snapshot of the view even if the browser has no javascript
